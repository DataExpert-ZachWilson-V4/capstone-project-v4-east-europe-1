# DataExpert.io Capstone Project

## Proposal

Work on a use case that utilizes Spotify's data. An initial rough idea is to use three main sources of data and build a data pipeline around them to measure some metrics and analytics. This is still being worked on as I am currently trying to understand the data I have and the business use case.

### Data Sources

AI Crowd - Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge - [Link](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)
- CSV format
- Around 5 GB in storage
- 1 Million+ rows
- Multiple relationships

Kaggle - Spotify 1.2M+ Songs - [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs/data)
- CSV format
- Around 0.5 GB in storage
- 1.2 Million rows
- Contains extra stats that are not available in the other dataset

Spotify Developer API
- API Data
- Can be used to get missing data or more data
- Can be used for streaming data if applicable

All three data sources have unique identifiers that I can use to merge them and utilize all the data available.
